# Introduction

**MelonJS** is a convenient JavaScript interface for interacting with the Melon Protocol smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to call functions on the contracts at every point of a fund's life cycle. We envision this functionality enabling a wide variety of apps, from fund creation and investor relations management to trading bots and automatic portfolio rebalancing.
