# Contract

The `Contract` class is MelonJS' base unit for all interactions with the blockchain. Though every Melon Protocol contract has various layers of abstraction, `Contract` gives each some base functionality:

* creating a `Deployment` of the contract
* querying the blockchain
* creating a `Transaction`
